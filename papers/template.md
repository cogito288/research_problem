## Summary 


The summary of a paper must includes 
1. Introduction of the paper: what is the problem, the motivation of the work., how the authors solved it, 
2. The problem that the method deals with   
3. strength and weakness of the paper. 

Do not use enumeration and itemize. Please write it as full paragraph. 


## Discussion (optional)


The discussion page must include 
1. *solved problem, unsolved problem, and new problem* of the paper.  
2. detailed discussion on the methods and evaluations on the paper. The readability should be clear that even the person who read the summary can understand the overall meaning. For example, don't say *BERT showed superior performance on GLUE benchmark.* Instead paraphrase the sentence as *BERT showed superior performance on GLUE Benchmark which includes 9 sentence-pair datasets to evaluate the general language models.*
