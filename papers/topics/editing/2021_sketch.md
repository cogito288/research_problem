üìåTL;DR: **How to customize GAN model given a few hand-drawn sketches**

## Problem 
* **üëÄ Motivation**: Rather than the collection of a large-scale dataset of exemplars, sketching is possibly the most universally accessible way to convey a visual concept.

* **‚ùì General Problem**: (Customization) Modify the weights of the original model (GAN) to match users' sketch. 

* **‚úÖ Solved**: They change the weights of an original GAN model and match the model output according to user sketches given one or more sketches.

* **ü§î Unsolved**: 
  - It is not guarantee to work for all sketches. The method cannot create a model that matches the pose faithfully sometimes.
  - Customizing a model in real-time. This method takes more than 30K iterations to train. 
  - It cannot customize other properties such as color and texture.

* **üí° New Problem** : 
  - Is customizing or inference editing in real time worth it?

* **üåπ if the proposed algorithm fundamentally solves the given problem and if it does, think about which aspect of the algorithm makes the problem solved**
  - It was a key to interpet this cutomization as a cross-domain image translation task.

## Discussion
Is there anything worthwhile to be customizing or speculative editing in real time? Is it a meaningful research direction?
